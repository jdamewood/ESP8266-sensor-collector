Here's a summary of the functions in datacollectionjsonGPIB.py and sensorreport.py suitable for a GitHub repository:

datacollectionjsonGPIB.py

This script collects sensor data from an ESP8266 and a Fluke 8845A multimeter, then saves it to a CSV file.

* initialize_gpib(): Initializes the GPIB connection to the Fluke 8845A multimeter. It uses the pyvisa library to establish communication and returns an instrument object for further use.

* read_fluke_voltage(instrument): Reads the DC voltage from the Fluke 8845A. It sends commands to configure the meter for DC voltage measurement and retrieves the reading.

* fetch_sensor_data_from_esp(): Retrieves sensor data (INA219 voltage/current, MPU6050 acceleration/rotation/temperature) from the ESP8266 web server by making an HTTP GET request.

* format_time(time_sec): Formats time in seconds to HH:MM:SS format.

* append_data_to_csv(data, fluke_voltage, filename): Appends the sensor data, along with the Fluke voltage reading, to a CSV file. It calculates the voltage difference and estimates battery capacity used via trapezoidal integration of current.

* create_csv_with_header(filename): Creates a new CSV file and writes the header row.

* fluke_reading_thread(instrument): Continuously reads voltage from the Fluke meter in a separate thread. The readings are placed in a queue for the main thread to process.

* main(): The main function that orchestrates the data collection process. It initializes the GPIB connection, creates the CSV file (if it doesn't exist), starts the Fluke reading thread, fetches data from the ESP8266, appends the data to the CSV file, and prints a summary at the end.

**sensorreport.py**

This script analyzes the data collected by datacollectionjsonGPIB.py from a CSV file and calculates accuracy statistics.

* calculate_rms_accuracy_with_stats(csv_file): This function is the core of the script. It reads data from a CSV file, filters data based on ESP8266 activity, calculates the Root Mean Square (RMS) accuracy, extracts duration, min/max errors, calculates 3-sigma control limits (UCL/LCL), counts outliers, estimates battery capacity, and computes statistics (average, min, and max) for acceleration, rotation, and temperature data.

It reads bus voltage, Fluke voltage, current, acceleration (X, Y, Z), rotation (X, Y, Z), temperature, and ESP8266 active status from the CSV.

* It calculates the difference between Fluke and bus voltage.

* It calculates RMS accuracy, duration, min/max error, UCL/LCL, and outlier count based on voltage differences.

* It estimates battery capacity.

* It calculates and includes the average, min, and max values for acceleration, rotation, and temperature.
